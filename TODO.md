# Ideas of improvements

## Opening XML files

- Not important: monitor XML files to detect modifications
- Not important: no need to remember the path and the uri ?

## Adding pictures

- Not important: ability to add a picture by drag-and-dropping the file from nautilus

## General

- Not important: less ugly message dialog
- Important: make the rows draggable
- Very important: ensure the memory is freed when deleting a row
- Not important: support more desktop environments (Pantheon ? Budgie ? Unity ? MATE ? Cinnamon ?)
- Not important: more clear and useful error messages, including line numbers

## Translations

- Important: provide translations to the description in `data/com.github.maoschanz.DynamicWallpaperEditor.appdata.xml.in` but without cluttering the `.po` file with release notes bullshit
- Not important: Provide translations for the help user manual
