# Ideas of improvements

## Opening XML files

- Important: opening files from the command line
- Not important: monitor files to detect modifications

## Adding pictures

- Not important: ability to add a picture by drag-and-dropping the file from nautilus

## General

- **Very important:** performance issues, the list should not be rebuild at each modification.
- Important: make the rows draggable
- Quite important: ensure the memory is freed when deleting a row
- Not important: support more desktop environments (Pantheon ? Budgie ? Unity ? MATE ? Cinnamon ?)
- Not important: more clear and useful error messages, including line numbers

## Translations

- Important: More languages
- Important: provide translations to the description in `data/com.github.maoschanz.DynamicWallpaperEditor.appdata.xml.in` but without cluttering the `.po` file with release notes bullshit
- Not important: Provide translations for the help user manual
