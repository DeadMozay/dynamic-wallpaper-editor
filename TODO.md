# Ideas of improvements

## Opening XML files

- Not important: monitor XML files to detect modifications

## Adding and managing pictures

- Important: ensure the memory is freed when deleting a row
- Not important: make the rows draggable
- Not important: ability to add a picture by drag-and-dropping the file from nautilus

## General

- UI: "modes" as radio buttons in the headerbar
- Very important: don't save the `/run/user/1000/doc/...` path in dconf ?????
- Not important: support more desktop environments (Pantheon ? Budgie ? Unity ? MATE ? Cinnamon ?)
- Not important: more clear and useful error messages, including line numbers

## Translations

- Important: provide translations to the description in `data/com.github.maoschanz.DynamicWallpaperEditor.appdata.xml.in` but without cluttering the `.po` file with release notes bullshit
- Not important: Provide translations for the help user manual
