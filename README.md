# Dynamic Wallpaper Editor

The GNOME desktop allows the wallpaper to be change with time. These dynamic wallpapers are XML files, and you don't want to write these files yourself: Dynamic Wallpaper Editor is a little utility for creation or edition of these XML wallpapers.

**This is a beta version, very incomplete.**
